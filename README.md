# Heart-Failure-Predictive-Analysis

In this group project, we analyzed a wide range of patient data, including medical history, vital signs, and lifestyle factors, we used the innovative approach of Machine Learning algorithms to assess and identify potential heart failure cases early on. Using predictive models and their evaluation metrics enabled personalized patient care plans and interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes, and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. This cutting-edge application of ML technology promises to revolutionize cardiac care by enhancing early detection and proactive management of heart failure.
